# CDDR_Variants_filtering
First make the variants data ready...
This is the data from the CDDR bulls sequencing project, aligned to ARS_UCD.v14 (variants called using bcftools) and lifted over to umd3 assembly (using a liftover chain generated by minmap2 alignment and sam2psl converter). 
All the vcf files (chr12chrX) are lifted over (using picard liftovervcf) and combined (using bcftools concat)
Combined vcf variants are given ids (bcftools annotate setID)

```bash
# working directory
/mnt/nfs/nfs1/derek.bickhart/CDDR-project/vcfs/condensed-vcfs/liftover
module load bcftools samtools
# Now to sort according to Chr and pos:
[kiranmayee.bakshy@assembler2 liftover]$ cat <(zcat combinedvcfs_id.gz | grep -B10000 -m1 ^#CHROM) <(bcftools view -H combinedvcfs_id.gz | sort -k1V,1 -k2n,2) | bgzip > combined.ids.sorted.vcf.gz
```
